# Email-Analysis

ðŸ“§ Excited to share my recent assignment on Email Analysis! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“š

I've been diving into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I wanted to apply my skills to a practical problem. For this assignment, I focused on analyzing emails using Python.

To begin the project, I imported essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and NLTK, which provided me with powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and natural language processing. I also sourced a dataset specifically curated for email analysis, allowing me to train and evaluate my models effectively.

One of the initial steps I took was renaming features to make them more intuitive and easier to work with. This simple adjustment streamlined the subsequent data preprocessing and analysis tasks, enhancing the overall clarity and understandability of the code.

To gain insights into the dataset, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA). This involved visualizing and summarizing the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential challenges. EDA allowed me to understand the distribution of email categories, such as spam or legitimate, and gather valuable insights for the subsequent stages of my analysis.

Additionally, I plotted sentiment words to visualize the distribution of positive or negative sentiment words in the email dataset. This analysis provided insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the emails, enabling me to better understand the emotional tone of the messages.

Preprocessing the text data was a critical step in my assignment. I applied techniques such as lowercasing, removing punctuation and stop words, and tokenization to prepare the emails for analysis. These preprocessing steps helped in reducing noise and improving the accuracy of subsequent models.
